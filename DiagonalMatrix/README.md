# Task Description
(This task was given as an assignment in BSc Computer Science - OOP course at Eötvös Loránd University)

Implement the block matrix type which contains integers. These are square matrices that can contain nonzero entries only in two blocks on their main diagonal. Let the size of the first and second blocks be b1 and b2, where 1≤b1,b2≤n-1 and b1+b2=n (in the example, b1=4 and b2=5). 
Don't store the zero entries. Store only the entries that can be nonzero in a sequence or two smaller matrices. 
Implement as methods: getting the entry located at index (i, j), adding and multiplying two matrices, and printing the matrix (in a square shape).
